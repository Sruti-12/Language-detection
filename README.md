The objective is to identify the language from the given input text. Especially in a country like India, language identification plays a major role where every single state has its own language and sublanguage. 
The majority of Natural language processing studies focus on the English language. At the same time, many Indian languages do not have that much reach as compared to English, thatâ€™s because people have difficulty identifying Indian languages.
NLP faces a lot of challenges with Indian languages, Lack of language grammar, literature, and documented standards, insufficient data, language ambiguity, and language complexity to name a few. To bring a digital presence to Indian languages, identification of the language is the first step. These kinds of identification systems are widely used in electronic devices such as mobiles, laptops, etc for machine translation, and also on robots. It helps in tracking and identifying multilingual documents too.
